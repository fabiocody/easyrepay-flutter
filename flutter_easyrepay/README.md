# EasyRepay

This is the Flutter port of EasyRepay, and app that allows you to write down all the money that you lend or borrow.

## TODO

- Remove slide to delete and add a long press menu.
- Do not create transaction before going to transaction detail.
- Remove decimal digits (`x.remainder(x.floor()) == 0` checks if the decimal part is 0).
- Mark completed transactions.
