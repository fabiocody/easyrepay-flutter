## Build and run (macOS)

In order to build and run the app on the Mac, you need to have the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) installed. In this section, we will only consider iOS as the target platform, so you will also need Xcode and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) to be installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fabiocody/easyrepay-flutter.git
$ cd easyrepay-flutter
$ open -a Simulator
$ flutter run
```
